                            The Hana's Tourist Destinations website was created because I wanted to travel around the world. 
                            I created this website to find out the various tourist destinations that I would like to visit when I have my own money. 
                            In addition, I am studying Information System and want to learn how to make websites to increase my knowledge and skills. 
                            I hope this website can inspire you to plan your own adventure.
