                            Lombok, part of the Lesser Sunda Islands in Indonesia, is located in West Nusa Tenggara province. It is separated from Bali by the Lombok Strait and from Sumbawa by the Alas Strait. The island is roughly circular with a southwestern peninsula and covers about 4,607.38 square kilometers. The provincial capital and largest city is Mataram. Lombok shares some cultural heritage with Bali but is part of the West Nusa Tenggara administrative region.                        </p>
                        <p class="indo-text">
                            As of mid-2023, Lombok had an estimated population of 3,963,842, up from 3,758,631 in the 2020 Census and 3,168,692 in the 2010 Census. The island is divided into four regencies and one city: West Lombok, North Lombok, Central Lombok, East Lombok, and the city of Mataram. Each administrative division has its own capital and governance under the provincial government of West Nusa Tenggara.

                            History of Lombok
                        </h3>
                            <p class="indo-text">
                                The 14th century Majapahit manuscript Nagarakretagama mentions "Lombok Mirah" as under Majapahit suzerainty, but little is known about Lombok before the 17th century, apart from the Babad Lombok document that records the 1257 Samalas eruption. Prior to this period, Lombok was composed of feuding petty states led by Sasak princes, which enabled the neighboring Balinese to control western Lombok in the early 17th century. The Makassarese invaded eastern Lombok, and by 1750, the Balinese had unified the island before internal conflicts divided it into four kingdoms. In 1838, the Mataram kingdom consolidated control. Relations between the Sasak and Balinese varied, with harmony in the west and tension in the east, where the Sasak were reduced to serfdom. Dutch intervention in 1894, invited by Sasak chiefs, led to the annexation of Lombok by the Netherlands East Indies in 1895, with the Dutch remembered as liberators from Balinese dominance.

                                During World War II, the Japanese occupied Lombok, defeating Dutch defenders in 1942. After the war, Lombok briefly returned to Dutch control before becoming part of Indonesia following independence. The island was incorporated into the province of West Nusa Tenggara in 1958. Mass killings of communists occurred post-independence, and under President Suharto's New Order (1967â€“1998), Lombok saw some stability and development. However, crop failures led to famine and food shortages, and the transmigrasi program relocated many residents. The 1980s tourism boom benefited mostly external developers, and the late 1990s crises hit Lombok hard, with riots in 2000 targeting Christians and ethnic Chinese. Recently, tourism has been growing again.

                                Lombok has a rich cultural heritage that is influenced by its history and diverse communities. Traditional Sasak culture is predominant on the island, with unique practices such as the Bau Nyale festival, where locals gather to catch sea worms believed to be the reincarnation of a legendary princess. The island also celebrates traditional dance and music, including the Gendang Beleq, a large drum played during ceremonies and celebrations.

                                The island's history of Hindu Balinese influence is evident in various temples and cultural practices. For example, the Pura Meru temple in Mataram is one of the largest and oldest Hindu temples on the island. Additionally, Lombok's art and crafts, such as pottery from Banyumulek and handwoven textiles from Sukarara, are significant aspects of its cultural identity.                        
                            </p>
                            <p class="indo-text">
                                Islamic traditions are also prominent, with Lombok being promoted as a halal tourism destination. This includes providing halal food, prayer facilities, and accommodation that adheres to Islamic principles. The combination of Sasak, Balinese, and Islamic traditions creates a unique cultural tapestry that defines Lombok's identity and attracts visitors seeking both cultural and religious experiences.
