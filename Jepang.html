                            Disneyland, the first theme park opened by the Walt Disney Company, is located at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. It was designed and constructed under the direct supervision of Walt Disney and opened on July 17, 1955. Initially intended to be adjacent to Disney's studios in Burbank, the site was moved to Anaheim due to space constraints. The park was created by a team selected by Disney, leading to the establishment of WED Enterprises, now known as Walt Disney Imagineering. Since its opening, Disneyland has seen numerous expansions, including New Orleans Square, Bear Country, Mickey's Toontown, and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge.

                        <p class="indo-text">
                            Disneyland has achieved remarkable popularity, with over 757 million visits since its opening. In 2022, it attracted approximately 16.9 million visitors, making it the second most visited amusement park globally. The Disneyland Resort supports around 65,700 jobs, including 20,000 direct Disney employees. To accommodate increasing visitor numbers, Disney launched "Project Stardust" in 2019, which involved significant structural renovations to the park.

                            History of DisneyLand
                        </h3>
                        <p class="indo-text">
                            The concept for Disneyland originated when Walt Disney envisioned a place where both adults and children could have fun together. Inspired by various attractions he had visited, Disney initially planned a "Mickey Mouse Park" near his Burbank studio. However, realizing the need for more space, he hired the Stanford Research Institute to find a suitable location, eventually purchasing a 160-acre site in Anaheim in 1953. Construction began in 1954, and Disneyland opened on July 17, 1955. The park quickly became a major tourist attraction, despite initial challenges such as counterfeit tickets and operational issues on opening day. Over the years, Disneyland expanded with new attractions and lands, including New Orleans Square, Bear Country, and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge.

                        <p class="indo-text">
                            Throughout the decades, Disneyland has continued to evolve, facing both challenges and triumphs. In the 1970s, the park saw protests and underwent several attraction changes. The late 1990s brought significant expansions, including the addition of Disney California Adventure and the Downtown Disney shopping district. In the 21st century, Disneyland celebrated major anniversaries with extensive refurbishments and new attractions. The park closed temporarily in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic but reopened in April 2021. Disneyland continues to innovate, planning future expansions and celebrating the centennial of The Walt Disney Company with new shows and attractions.

                            Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California, consists of nine themed lands: Main Street, U.S.A., Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland, Tomorrowland, New Orleans Square, Critter Country, Mickey's Toontown, and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge. The park originally opened with Main Street, U.S.A., Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland. Over the years, it added New Orleans Square in 1966, Bear Country (now Critter Country) in 1972, Mickey's Toontown in 1993, and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in 2019.

                        <p class="indo-text">
                            Each land has unique attractions and themes. Main Street, U.S.A., is inspired by early 20th-century Midwest towns, featuring a train station and various shops. Adventureland evokes exotic tropical locales with rides like Jungle Cruise and Indiana Jones Adventure. New Orleans Square captures 19th-century New Orleans, home to Pirates of the Caribbean and the Haunted Mansion. Frontierland represents America's pioneer days with attractions such as Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. Critter Country, once Bear Country, features Tiana's Bayou Adventure and Winnie the Pooh rides. Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge immerses guests in the Star Wars universe with Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run and Rise of the Resistance.

                            Fantasyland, styled as a Bavarian village, hosts classic Disney dark rides like Peter Pan's Flight. Mickey's Toontown, inspired by 1930s cartoons, includes rides like Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway. Tomorrowland showcases futuristic adventures with attractions like Space Mountain and Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters. The park's unique blend of themes and attractions has evolved since its opening in 1955, continuing to enchant visitors of all ages.
